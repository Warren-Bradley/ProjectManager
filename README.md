# ProjectManager

## Brief description

This program is intended to create a means for a company to create and track projects within a contruction company. This includes tracking the architects, 
contractors and customers of the projects. Once a project is finished the software will produce an invoice for the customer.

The individual files were the first version of the project while the file called PoisedProjectManagement holds the second version which is the program that meets the full requirements of the project, using text files as a means to save and store the required data

## Requested functionality for the program:

### To be tracked in each project

- Project number
- Project Name
- Tyoe of building (Eg house, apartment block, store etc)
- ERF number
- Total Cost of project
- Total amount paid to date
- Deadline
- Name, telephone number email andaddress of architect
- Name, telephone number email andaddress of contractor
- Name, telephone number email andaddress of customer

### Requested functionality

- Capture information about ew projects. If a project name is not provided when the iformation is captured, name the project using the surname of the customer and building type.
- Update information about existing projects. Information can change throughout a project such as a change in deadline, amount paid etc.
- Finalise existing projects resulting in the following:  
  - An invoice should be generated for the client containing the total that must still be paid.
  - The project should be marked as 'finalised' along with tracking it's completion date.
- Find all projects that still need to be completed
- Find all projects that are past the due date
