# ProjectManager

## Brief description

This program is intended to create a means for a company to create and track projects within a contruction company. This includes tracking the architects, 
contractors and customers of the projects. Once a project is finished the software will produce an invoice for the customer.

The individual files were the first version of the project while the file called PoisedProjectManagement holds the second version which is the program that meets the full requirements of the project, using text files as a means to save and store the required data
