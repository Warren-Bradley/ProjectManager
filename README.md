# ProjectManager

This program is intended to create a means for a company to create and track projects within a contruction company. This includes tracking the architects, 
contractors and customers of the projects.\n\n

The architects and contractors, as resources that will often be reused in multiple projects are created seperately and stored within the class Company and then allocated to each 
project. Where as the customers are more likely to be unique to each project and so are only created and stored with each project.
